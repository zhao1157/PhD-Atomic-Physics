# PhD-Atomic-Physics
This repository includes the main code I wrote for my research in pursuit of an atomic physics PhD degree at the Ohio State University. Note: usually the order of executing the scripts in a folder is the same as the index just before the extension. For example, *a_1.sh*, and *b_2.sh* are in the same directory, so the order of executing them is *a_1.sh* followed by *b_2.sh*. The same rules applies to directories.
