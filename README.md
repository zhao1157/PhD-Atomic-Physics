# PhD-Atomic-Physics
This repository includes the main code I wrote for my research in pursuit of an atomic physics PhD degree at the Ohio State University. Note: usually the order of executing the scripts in a folder is the same as the index just before the extension. For example, *a_1.sh*, and *b_2.sh* are in the same directory, so the order of executing them is *a_1.sh* followed by *b_2.sh*. The same rules applies to directories.
## BPRM
- Input files for BPRM:
  - *couple_core_e_0.sh*: in stg2, we need to couple the quantumn numbers **S** and **L** of the target states with those of the outer electron, so this script does this job.
  - *recupd_core_2j_p_0.sh*: in recupd, it can be really tedious to manually input the **2J** and **\pi**
